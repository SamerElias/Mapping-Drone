				<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
				The aim of our project is to build a map in a real-time manner, in other words, it is a scanner that will scan the area that the drone traverses above.
				The information is stored as coordinates in a data structure, and the display will be a window that will show a map of the area around the drone, the map consists of tiles, where each tile is a picture taken from the drone.
				The information that will be stored and viewed is: global position, an interactive flight map of the drone and a photographic map.

				<h2>Details</h2>
				The project is used as a library for other different projects and purposes, it does not directly use a drone since it does not affect it, it gathers information from it and this information is used for various things, in other words, it is a useful tool for other new ideas. and as mentioned in the PDF below, the project can be used with virtually any moving objects, not only a drone.
